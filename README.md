# Beginners Guide To PyTorch
Extremely detailed documentation of the PyTorch tutorial

Welcome! This is my very first brush with PyTorch. I was reading through the PyTorch tutorials and I felt that they skipped over a lot of the explanations. That isn't really helpful for beginners. So I thought it would be good to do an __extremely documented__ version of the PyTorch tutorial. There are only minor changes to the code. I had so much fun and learnt so much just by doing this. Hope you will have fun too! :D
